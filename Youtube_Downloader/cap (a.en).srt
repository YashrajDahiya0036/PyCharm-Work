time paradox

161
18:43:59,000 --> 20:17:00,000
yeah it's time travel yeah I don't know

163
19:35:00,000 --> 21:16:00,000
it's just happening forward backward

165
20:17:00,000 --> 21:31:00,000
minutes or seconds totally random time

167
21:16:00,000 --> 22:32:00,000
travel

169
21:31:00,000 --> 23:02:00,000
one door opens another closes fix the

171
22:32:00,000 --> 23:45:20,000
paradox

173
23:02:00,000 --> 00:45:20,000
kill your future

175
23:45:20,000 --> 00:45:20,000
what you were right

177
01:02:00,000 --> 02:36:59,000
you were right

179
01:46:59,000 --> 03:19:00,000
about the Stalls you just go in come out

181
02:36:59,000 --> 04:09:00,000
that's how it works

183
03:19:00,000 --> 04:09:00,000
oh

185
04:21:20,000 --> 05:46:20,000
I just told

187
04:55:59,000 --> 05:46:20,000
me that

189
05:53:00,000 --> 08:01:20,000
this isn't real that's what I said

191
07:03:00,000 --> 08:01:20,000
you're not real that's what I said

193
08:01:59,000 --> 09:10:00,000
go into the song you'll see

195
08:33:00,000 --> 09:52:19,000
I'm not going anywhere that's what I say

197
09:10:00,000 --> 09:52:19,000
that's what I

199
09:53:59,000 --> 10:55:00,000
I know you're freaked out

201
10:28:00,000 --> 11:44:00,000
believe me

203
10:55:00,000 --> 12:11:59,000
a couple minutes ago when I was you I

205
11:44:00,000 --> 12:49:59,000
didn't believe me either

207
12:11:59,000 --> 13:18:00,000
but if you go into that stall you come

209
12:49:59,000 --> 13:38:59,000
back out you're going to be right where

211
13:18:00,000 --> 14:16:00,000
I'm standing now

213
13:38:59,000 --> 14:43:59,000
and you'll see what I'm talking about

215
14:16:00,000 --> 15:31:20,000
I'll see

217
14:43:59,000 --> 15:31:20,000
you will be me

219
15:46:59,000 --> 16:29:20,000
no

221
17:08:00,000 --> 17:42:20,000
no

223
17:49:59,000 --> 19:16:59,000
what no no what

225
18:47:00,000 --> 20:17:19,000
this is different

227
19:16:59,000 --> 20:17:19,000
I didn't say that this is all different

229
21:47:59,000 --> 23:45:00,000
okay time travel

231
22:42:59,000 --> 01:00:00,000
so there's like a timeline

233
23:45:00,000 --> 01:27:00,000
dead guy's watch is broken here at 3 30.

235
01:00:00,000 --> 02:11:00,000
that's

237
01:27:00,000 --> 03:16:00,000
10 minutes from now by my watch

239
02:11:00,000 --> 04:14:00,000
it's 12 by mine okay so you are two

241
03:16:00,000 --> 05:01:59,000
minutes from where I am and then there's

243
04:14:00,000 --> 05:31:19,000
something about folding a piece of paper

245
05:01:59,000 --> 06:25:00,000
and pushing them

247
05:31:19,000 --> 07:11:00,000
pencil through it

249
06:25:00,000 --> 07:56:59,000
we're doing 80s time travel I'm here

251
07:11:00,000 --> 08:17:59,000
you're here we die here somehow we're

253
07:56:59,000 --> 09:00:00,000
gonna make it out of here live we've got

255
08:17:59,000 --> 09:44:00,000
to keep here from happening right

257
09:00:00,000 --> 09:58:59,000
so we go here instead create a new

259
09:44:00,000 --> 10:33:00,000
timeline

261
09:58:59,000 --> 11:14:20,000
that's how Dr Marty did it

263
10:33:00,000 --> 11:14:20,000
okay

265
11:15:59,000 --> 12:21:00,000
easy

267
11:33:00,000 --> 12:52:59,000
you're me from the future right yeah so

269
12:21:00,000 --> 13:33:00,000
I just do something you did Future's

271
12:52:59,000 --> 14:09:59,000
changed new timeline

273
13:33:00,000 --> 14:36:59,000
no that's the problem

275
14:09:59,000 --> 15:08:00,000
I went into the stall again and you

277
14:36:59,000 --> 15:42:00,000
didn't you should already be me but

279
15:08:00,000 --> 16:13:59,000
you're nuts that's the Paradox now we

281
15:42:00,000 --> 17:01:00,000
both just exist

283
16:13:59,000 --> 17:48:00,000
right

285
17:01:00,000 --> 19:13:20,000
okay so the note said kill the future

287
17:48:00,000 --> 19:13:20,000
close the door close so so

289
19:17:00,000 --> 20:38:20,000
you're from the future

291
19:56:00,000 --> 20:38:20,000
yeah

293
20:48:20,000 --> 22:15:00,000
oh come on look I'm not saying it's

295
21:31:00,000 --> 22:37:00,000

yourself why do I have because you took

311
02:13:59,000 --> 03:18:00,000
it look it's time travel don't overthink

313
03:01:00,000 --> 04:09:00,000
it

315
03:18:00,000 --> 04:51:00,000

overthink this

321
05:14:00,000 --> 06:12:00,000
look man you can't change the future

323
05:43:00,000 --> 07:04:00,000
you're from the future

325
06:12:00,000 --> 07:27:00,000
two minutes and that means that I'm in

327
07:04:00,000 --> 08:00:00,000
